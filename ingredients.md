Add your base: This is normally 1 mashed banana but can be sugarless applesauce.
Oats: Add 2 cups of oats to add to the cookies.
Flour: Add 1 cup almond or oat flour.
Baking Soda: 1 tsp of baking soda.
Spices: Add 1 tsp cinammon and 1 tbsp salt. Add 1/8 cup honey
Texture: Add 3 tbsp of melted coconut oil, and 1 cup milk or almond milk. Also add 1 cup grinded flaxseed.
Toppings: You can not personalize your cookie by adding whatever toppings you want. Make sure to grind things like nuts so they are not giants peices in the cookie. My preferences are sunflower seed with chia seed, rasins, almonds, walnuts, dates, and chocolate.
